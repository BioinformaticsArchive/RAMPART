# This is the weightings file.  The user can adjust these settings (or make a copy of this file and use that instead) to
# alter the way RAMPART scores and ranks assemblies.  Changing the settings here affects the impact that metric has when
# contributing the overall score.  Higher weighting equals more impact.  The metrics are also grouped into 3 different
# categories.  The weightings for the categories can also be adjusted giving the user higher-level control.
# Note that the user may not use all metrics in their assembly experiments.  In these cases those metrics do not contribute
# to the overall score and its weighting is distributed to the remaining metrics in the group, retaining their existing
# weighting balance in the group.
