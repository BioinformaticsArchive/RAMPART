{"name":"Rampart","tagline":"A configurable de novo assembly pipeline","body":"RAMPART\r\n=======\r\n\r\nRAMPART is a configurable pipeline for *de novo* assembly of DNA sequence data. RAMPART is not a *de novo* assembler.\r\nThere are already many very good freely available assembly tools, however, few will always produce a good assembly first time\r\nusing the default settings. Sometimes one particular assembler may perform well on your data and genome, but in other\r\ncases another performs better. Sometimes an assembly will be better if the reads are error corrected, other times not.\r\nAlso depending on the data available, it maybe possible to improve the assembly with additional scaffolding or gap\r\nfilling steps. There are many combinations of tools that could be tried and no clear way of knowing *a priori*, which will\r\nwork best. RAMPART can be though of as a framework for these kinds of assembly projects. It is pipeline makes use of\r\ntried and tested tools for read pre-processing, assembly and assembly improvement, that allows the user to configure\r\nthese tools and specify how they should be executed in a single configuration file. RAMPART also provides options for\r\ncomparing and analysing sequence data and assemblies.\r\n\r\nThis README file contains some brief information about how to install and get up and running with RAMPART.  For MUCH more\r\ninformation please read the manual, which can be found in the doc subdirectory, or online at::\r\n\r\nhttp://rampart.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to install RAMPART, the easiest and quickest way is from a distribute tarball.  The other is from\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nFrom tarball it is simply a matter of extracting to a directory of your choice: ``tar -xvf <name_of_tarball>``.\r\n\r\nFrom source, you will first need the following dependencies installed:\r\n\r\n* GIT\r\n* Maven 3\r\n* JDK v1.7+\r\n* Sphinx and texlive (If you would like to compile the manual.  If these are not installed you must comment out the create-manual execution element from the pom.xml file.))\r\n\r\nYou also need to make sure that the system to are compiling on has internet access, as it will try to automatically\r\nincorporate any required java dependencies via maven. Now type the following::\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/TGAC/RAMPART.git\r\n    cd RAMPART\r\n    mvn clean install\r\n\r\nNote: If you cannot clone the git repositories using \"https\", please try \"ssh\" instead. Consult github to obtain the\r\nspecific URLs.\r\n\r\nAssuming there were no compilation errors. The build can be found in ./build/rampart-<version>. There should also be a\r\ndist sub directory which will contain a tarball suitable for installing RAMPART on other systems.\r\n\r\nNext RAMPART's dependencies must be installed. To assist with this RAMPART provides a dependency downloader tool.\r\nTo use this, after the core RAMPART pipeline is compiled and configured (see below for more information on that, then\r\ntype): ``rampart-download-deps <dir>``\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Information\r\n================\r\n\r\nNow that RAMPART is installed you can consult the full manual for details on how to install dependencies, configure\r\nRAMPART and start running jobs.  This manual can be found in the ``doc`` directory in the build, or online at::\r\n\r\n   http://rampart.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nRAMPART is available under GNU GLP V3: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt\r\n\r\nFor licensing details of other RAMPART dependencies please consult their own documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\n\r\nDaniel Mapleson - Analysis Pipelines Project Leader at The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC)\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.tgac.ac.uk/bioinformatics/genome-analysis/daniel-mapleson/\r\n\r\nEmail: daniel.mapleson@tgac.ac.uk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n================\r\n\r\n* Bernardo Clavijo (TGAC)\r\n* Robert Davey (TGAC)\r\n* Tony Burdett (EBI)\r\n* Ricardo Ramirez (TGAC)\r\n* Nizar Drou (Formerly TGAC)\r\n* David Swarbreck (TGAC)\r\n* And everyone who contributed to making the tools RAMPART depends on!\r\n","google":"UA-48144168-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
